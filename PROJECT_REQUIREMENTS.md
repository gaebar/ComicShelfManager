# Paired Programming Project Summary and Requirements

**Due Date:** Monday Morning, 4/22

**Presentation Style:** Project teams will share their screen and walk through the projectâ€™s functionalities with HTTP requests sent through Postman. 5 minutes max. Since this project is so short, there is no need for everyone to talk. Check the Associate Name and Email List for project teams! Please let me know if any teams want to switch members by Wednesday.

**Pressure:** Low

**After presentations:** Finish the rest of the Front-End topics :)

## Executive Summary

The goal of the Paired Programming Project is to create a basic user/item management application. The type of items managed is completely up to you. (Collectible items? Animals? Books? Video Games?). The app shall include two database tables with a PK/FK relationship between them. For example, users and books. Imagine that this app is for admins managing the users and the items, not for the actual users themselves.

## User Stories (what can this app do?)

Users of the application can:

- Select all items from the items table
- Select one item by its ID
- Select all items that belong to a certain user
- Insert a new item into the items table
- Insert a new user into the users table
- Update a user
- Delete an item
- [Some other functionality of your choice]

This project should be easy enough to complete if you remember your Spring topics. Iâ€™ll be happy to meet any teams to help with conceptual stuff or debugs during office hours. This should serve as practice for two things: Application creation and Application design. Revature pretraining doesnâ€™t give quite enough practice with that. If your team feels motivated to go beyond the requirements, feel free. Just remember the 5 minute time limit.

Remember to consult the demo, other teams, and Google ðŸŽ‰
